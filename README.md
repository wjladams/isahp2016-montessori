# ISAHP 2016 Montessori Job Choices Project
This is the github repository for the ISAHP 2016 project
designed by Will Adams and his father Dr. William Adams.  The results of this research will
be presented at the [ISAHP 2016 conference in London](http://www.isahp.org/).

# Research Goals
* Understand the preferences of the children for job areas and particular job types.
* Aid the Montessori teacher in assigning jobs to students based upon preferences.
* Perform an analysis to understand what groups of children prefer which jobs.
* Create a web application where this information is visible.
* Create a methodology and software so that other Montessori teachers can use the methods we develop.
